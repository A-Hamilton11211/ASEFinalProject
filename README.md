To operate our app, simply run the OutputPrintManager class.
Main is where all of our files not used for testing are, while testing is where all our Junit tests are located.
Additionally, you may need to add JUnit to the project's Java Build Path in order to get the tests working in
Eclipse.  This can be done by right clicking on the project directory, going to properties, clicking Java Build Path,
clicking the add library button, and adding JUnit.  After this is done, JUnit tests should work.
